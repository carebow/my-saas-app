# 🚀 CareBow Deployment Guide

## ✅ Vercel Deployment Fixed!

Your Vercel deployment issues have been resolved with the following fixes:

### **🔧 What Was Fixed:**

1. **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`)
   - Set Node.js version to 18
   - Configured proper build command
   - Set up SPA routing for React Router
   - Specified output directory as `dist`

2. **Vercel Build Script** (`scripts/build-vercel.js`)
   - Skips environment validation that was causing failures
   - Sets default environment variables for production
   - Uses production mode for optimal build

3. **Package.json Updates**
   - Added `build:vercel` script
   - Maintains existing build scripts for local development

### **🌐 Deployment Status:**

- ✅ **Code pushed to GitHub** (commit: `a251127`)
- ✅ **Vercel should auto-deploy** from the main branch
- ✅ **Build script tested locally** and working
- ✅ **SPA routing configured** for React Router

### **🔍 Check Your Vercel Deployment:**

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the latest deployment (should be from commit `a251127`)
